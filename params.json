{"name":"MacFolket","tagline":"A Swedish <-> English dictionary for Mac OS X","body":"# MacFolket\r\n\r\nA Swedish - English dictionary for Mac OS X which is nicely integrated into the system.\r\n\r\n**[Download](http://macfolket.googlecode.com/files/MacFolket-2013-03-06.pkg)**\r\n\r\n\r\n## Screenshot\r\n\r\n![Screenshot](https://github.com/hashier/MacFolket/raw/master/images/svendict.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Video\r\n\r\n[![Video](http://img.youtube.com/vi/gWR_BvioaVw/0.jpg)](http://youtu.be/gWR_BvioaVw \"This video shows the installation\")\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nYou can find ready to install .pkg file here: [Download](http://macfolket.googlecode.com/files/MacFolket-2013-03-06.pkg)\r\n\r\nIf you run into problems while opening the .pkg file like this:\r\n\r\n![Undef](https://github.com/hashier/MacFolket/raw/master/images/undef.png)\r\n\r\nYou can work around this problem by right clicking or Ctrl+clicking on the .pkg file and select \"Open\" from the context menu. On [imore](http://www.imore.com/how-open-apps-unidentified-developer-os-x-mountain-lion) you can find pictures how to do it and even a second way.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Building\r\n\r\n- Clone this git repository\r\n- Download Apples [Dictionary Development Kit](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/) (The packages is called \"Auxiliary Tools for Xcode\")\r\n- Copy the \"Dictionary Development Kit\" somewhere and adjust the Makefile accordingly\r\n- make\r\n- Optional make validate (you need to install jing for that)\r\n- make install\r\n\r\n\r\n## Caveats\r\n\r\n- Only the first entry is displayed in pop-up mode instead of all (e.g. \"boken\" shows only \"beech\") but you will see all of them in dictionary.app.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Thanks to\r\n\r\nPhilipp Brauner who build an English <-> German dictionary which I have used now for a couple of years. His plugin gave me the idea to build an English <-> Swedish one.\r\nHere you can find his English <-> German one: http://lipflip.org/articles/dictcc-dictionary-plugin.\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-40437058-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
